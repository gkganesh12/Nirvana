📱 1. Mobile Application (Critical Gap)
Missing: A native iOS/Android app.
Industry Standard: PagerDuty/Opsgenie rely heavily on mobile apps for critical "wake-up" alerts (push notifications that override Do Not Disturb), managing incidents on the go, and acknowledge/resolve actions.
Current State: Responsive web only.
🔌 2. Integration Ecosystem
Missing: Native integrations for major Cloud Providers (AWS CloudWatch, Azure, GCP), Ticketing Systems (Jira, ServiceNow, Zendesk), and other observability tools (New Relic, Dynatrace, Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk).
Industry Standard: 700+ integrations.
Current State: Supports Sentry, Slack, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Datadog, Teams, Discord.
🔥 3. Incident Management Lifecycle
Missing:
War Rooms: Automatic creation of Zoom bridges or Slack channels dedicated to an incident.
Post-Mortems: Automated generation of incident timelines and post-mortem documents.
Status Pages: Public or private status pages to communicate downtime (e.g., statuspage.io integration).
Incident Roles: Explicit roles like "Incident Commander", "Scribe", "Liaison".
Current State: Basic Alert Grouping and Resolution.
🗓️ 4. Advanced On-Call Logic
Missing:
Complex Rotations: "Follow-the-sun" (24/7 global), multi-layered schedules with fallbacks.
Temporary Overrides: Vacation coverage logic, calendar integrations (GCal/Outlook).
Current State: Supports basic Rotations, Layers, and Overrides (UI appears to exist, but logic might be simple).
🤖 5. Proactive AI & Intelligence
Missing:
Anomaly Detection: Predicting incidents based on metric deviations before they trigger hard thresholds.
Root Cause Analysis: Deep linking of related deployment events or changelogs to alerts.
Current State: Reactive "Resolution Suggestions" via LLM (RAG-lite).
🛠️ 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Missing: Terraform Provider or Kubernetes Operator to manage SignalCraft configuration (Teams, Services, Rules) as code.
Industry Standard: Enterprise users demand managing monitoring config via git (GitOps).
🔄 7. Bi-Directional Sync
Missing: Deep two-way sync. If I mute an alert in SignalCraft, does it mute in Datadog? If I resolve in PagerDuty, does false-positive feedback loop back?
Current State: Likely one-way ingestion or simple webhook callbacks.
